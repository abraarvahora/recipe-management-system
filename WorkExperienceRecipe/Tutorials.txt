HTML is the basic building blocks of a web page, what content there is in the page. And what type of content it is.

so h1 means biggest type of heading and to write "Hello I am a heading" in html you would write:

<h1>Hello I am a heading</h1> 



CSS is the application of styling rules to HTML so

h1 {
    background-color: blue;
    color: red;
}

Will make all of the biggest header elements on the page (H1 elements) have a blue background and red text.


Javascript (and jquery is a set of tools written in javascript) is the language we use control what happens on a web page logically when certain things happen, when the page loads, when a button is clicked etc

<script language="javascript">
    window.onLoad(
        alert("I have loaded");
    );
</script>

So the code above will make the web browser pop up an alert message when it loads the page.
